# Front-end Coding Challenge

This is our coding challenge for the front-end developer position at [Hidden Founders](https://hiddenfounders.com). 

## About the Challenge
For this challenge, you'll be converting a [mockup design](https://invis.io/T7DBK3YQ6#/251649617_Page_1) to a responsive web page. 

## Basic requirements
* The final result should look like [this mockup](https://invis.io/T7DBK3YQ6#/251649617_Page_1).
* The page must be responsive.
* The page shouldn't be static. It needs some logic to show data dynamically.

## How we'll evaluate
* Your code will be evaluated by: semantics, structure, legibility, size, among other factors.
* The git commit history will be also evaluated.

## How to get started
* Create a Github repo and remember to commit early and often. 
* Solve this challenge in the best way you can.
* Send us the URL to your Github repo by email once you're done.

## Few tips
* While there is no limitations with regards to which tools or libraries to use, remember to always choose the right tool for the job.
* Despite not having a time limit, we recommend that you don't spend more than few days working on this challenge.
* Do not forget documentation. Or how are we going to evaluate your work if we can't init the project on our machines?
